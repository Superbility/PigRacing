# Pig Racing

Pig racing  is a minigame type plugin designed for timed events in a larger server. It involves a pre-game lobby, checkpoints and of course - flying pigs!

Players race around a track passing through different checkpoints and increasing in speed with each one passed. The pigs are controlled in a flappy-bird style way in which they tap space to go up and fall otherwise. If a player hits the floor they are reset to the last checkpoint and their speed reset, but fear not, players can hit each other to sabotage!

At the end of the race a leaderboard will be presented, giving the top 3 players and your points as well as evenly distributing rewards depending on each player's position!
